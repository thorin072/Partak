# Mobile application "Robot Artist" (Partak)
This mobile app is designed to work with the Dobot Magican robotic system. The mobile app allows the user to draw an image on the smartphone screen and the robotic cell will repeat it in real time. For more information, see the file: info.png.

This repository contains a copy of the latest version of the application for testing (Partak.apk). 
For further communication with the robot, the second part of the SOFTWARE is required to control and read the received QR code.
